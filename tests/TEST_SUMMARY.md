# Test Suite Summary

## Overview

Created a comprehensive test suite for the Excalidraw application with **147 passing tests** across 5 test files.

## What Was Created

### 1. Test Infrastructure

- ✅ Vitest configuration (`vitest.config.ts`)
- ✅ Test setup file with mocks (`src/setupTests.ts`)
- ✅ Testing dependencies installed via npm
- ✅ Test scripts added to package.json

### 2. Test Files

#### `src/lib/__tests__/websocket.test.ts` (22 tests)

Tests WebSocket collaboration client with focus on:

- Connection failures and timeouts
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Disconnect/reconnect scenarios
- Edge cases (invalid URLs, malformed errors)

#### `src/lib/__tests__/storage.test.ts` (45 tests)

Comprehensive storage layer testing:

- **ServerStorage**: Network failures (404, 500, timeouts), large payloads
- **LocalStorage**: Tauri integration, database errors
- Drawing and snapshot CRUD operations
- Invalid data handling
- Room settings management

#### `src/lib/__tests__/reconciliation.test.ts` (32 tests)

Complex reconciliation logic verification:

- Version conflict resolution
- Concurrent edits from multiple users
- Z-index ordering with `preceding_element_key`
- Editing state protection
- Large array handling (1000+ elements)

#### `src/lib/__tests__/api.test.ts` (28 tests)

API layer testing:

- Configuration management
- Connection lifecycle
- Error propagation
- URL validation

#### `src/components/__tests__/ConnectionDialog.test.tsx` (20 tests)

React component testing:

- User interactions (typing, clicking, form submission)
- Error states and validation
- Accessibility compliance
- Edge cases (corrupted localStorage, missing props)

### 3. Test Runner Script

- ✅ `tests/client/run.sh` - Automated test execution script
- Handles dependency installation
- Provides clear output with status indicators
- Exit codes for CI/CD integration

### 4. GitHub Actions CI Workflow

- ✅ `.github/workflows/ci.yml` updated
- **Server Pipeline:** Lint → Test → Build (Go binary for Linux)
- **Client Pipeline:** Lint → Test → Build (matrix: Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Builds actual Tauri desktop executables:
  - Linux: .deb, .AppImage
  - macOS: .dmg, .app
  - Windows: .msi, .exe
- Parallel execution across 4 jobs
- Platform-specific dependency installation
- Triggers on push and pull requests to main

## Test Philosophy

### Not Taking the Happy Path ✨

All tests focus on **edge cases, errors, and failure scenarios**:

1. **Network Failures**

   - Connection timeouts
   - Server errors (404, 500)
   - Malformed responses
   - Dropped connections

2. **Data Edge Cases**

   - Empty/null values
   - Very large datasets (1000+ items)
   - Corrupted JSON
   - Special characters
   - Missing required fields

3. **Concurrency Issues**

   - Multiple users editing simultaneously
   - Version conflicts
   - Race conditions
   - State synchronization

4. **User Input Validation**
   - Invalid URLs
   - Empty fields
   - Special characters in room IDs
   - Rapid interactions

## Running Tests

### Locally

```bash
# From excalidraw-app directory
npm test

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch

# With UI
npm run test:ui
```

### Via Test Runner

```bash
# From repository root
./tests/client/run.sh
```

### In CI

Tests run automatically on every push and PR to main branch.

## Test Results

```
✅ Test Files: 5 passed (5)
✅ Tests: 147 passed (147)
⏱️  Duration: ~1-3 seconds
```

## Dependencies Added

- `vitest` - Fast unit test framework
- `@vitest/ui` - Test UI for development
- `@testing-library/react` - React component testing
- `@testing-library/jest-dom` - DOM matchers
- `@testing-library/user-event` - User interaction simulation
- `@testing-library/dom` - DOM utilities
- `jsdom` - DOM environment for Node.js
- `socket.io-mock` - WebSocket mocking

## Key Features

### Realistic Error Simulation

- Network timeouts and failures
- Server errors (4xx, 5xx)
- Corrupted data streams
- Database failures

### Comprehensive Edge Case Coverage

- Boundary conditions (empty, null, very large)
- Special characters and invalid input
- Concurrent operations
- State management edge cases

### Accessibility Testing

- Proper ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility

### Performance Testing

- Large dataset handling (1000+ elements)
- Rapid user interactions
- Memory leak prevention

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:

- E2E tests with Playwright (browser automation)
- Visual regression tests
- Performance benchmarks
- Integration tests with real backend
- Code coverage reporting

## Maintainance

- Tests use descriptive names following pattern: "should [expected behavior] when [condition]"
- Each test is independent and can run in isolation
- Mocks are reset between tests
- Tests are organized by feature/module
